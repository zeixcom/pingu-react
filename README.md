# Pingu-react
Package for extending https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

## Getting started
Disclaimer: This will change as soon as a more or less stable version has been achieved.

**Step 1.** Make sure you have `yeoman` `create-react-app` installed.

**Step 2.** Create a project by running `create-react-app <project-name>`.

**Step 3.** Change into your new project root and run `npm run eject`.

**Step 4.** Clone this project into a subfolder in your newly created project (e.g. `internals/generator`).

**Step 5.** Change into the generator's directory and run either `yarn link` or `npm link`.

**Step 6.** Change back to your project root and run `yo pingu`. This will add new project dependencies and create some
files.

**Step 7.** Start creating components with `yo pingu:component`.
